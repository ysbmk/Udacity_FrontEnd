## Instructions

This project is for Udacity Front End Web Devvelopper Nanodegree Program to practice interactive landing page using html, css, and javascript.

It is mainly to demonstrate how to layout and how to respond to the actions on the website such as scrolling using javascript.
The top navigation bar is created using javascript. 
As it'll be shown once index.html is opened on a browser, the top navigation bar is styled using javascript and the animation and styling changes when the page is scrolled.
